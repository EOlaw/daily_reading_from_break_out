        March_06 = "Some people go through life with a cup, others have a bucket, and some have a barrel. Yet there's one other group. They believe in far-and-beyond favor. They believe God will prosper them even in a recession. They believe their children will be mighty in the land. They're expecting explosive blessings and unprecedented favor. They know they've come into a shift and a supernatural increase is coming. Their faith is so strong they have a barn." +
                    'Jesus said, "According to your faith, it will be done unto you." He was saying in effect, "If you have a cup, I"ll find you with a cupful of blessings."" If you have a barrel, I"ll find you with a barrelful of blessings. But if you have a barn, I will give you a barnful of blessings."',

                    "My question is: How many containers are you borrowing? What kind of vision do you have for your life? If you think, 'The economy is so bad, and I'm just hoping to survive', God says,'All right, I'll fill that barely-get-by-container.' Or maybe you believe you can pay your bills, feed your family, and have a little left over. That's good. God will fill those containers. But I believe you are different. You have radical faith. You're calling Home Depot to say: 'I need a couple thousand empty containers.'",
        march_13 = "Like the widow woman and the pots of cooking oil, God wants to bless you beyond your normal income, beyond your salary, and beyond your retirement. He can do exceedingly abundantly above and beyond. He is El Shaddai, the God who is more than enough. God is saying, 'You need to get ready. I'm going to fill your containers.' It may not have happened yet, but God has favor in your future." + 
                    "You're positioned under the open windows of Heaven. You may not see how it can happen, but God has ways to increase you that you've never thought of. Make room for this far-and-beyond favor. God has explosive blessings that can thrust you to a new level. He can give you one good break; one promotion, one inheritance, and all those containers will be filled to overflowing."
