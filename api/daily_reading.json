He is lining it all up. What you could not make happen on your own, God will cause you to accomplish. It will be bigger than you thought. It will happen quicker than you imagined, and it will be more rewarding than you ever dreamed possible. One touch of God's favor can get you to where you're supposed to be. The truth is, you are one shift from seeing a dream come to pass. One shift from praying your house off. One shift from seeing your health improve. One shift from meeting the right person."

But God is saying, 'Get ready. I'm about to shift things.' Doors will open for you that have not opened in the past. Those who were against you will suddenly change their minds and be for you. Problems that have dogged you for years will suddenly turn around. You are coming into a shift. Because you have honored God, He will put you in a position you never could have attained on your own. It's not just your education, not just your talent, or the family you come from. It's the hand of God shifting you to a new level of your destiny."
